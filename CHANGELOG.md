# Changelog

All notable changes to Laravel Fun Lab will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## 0.6.0 — 2026-08-07

### Changed

- **BREAKING — PHP 8.2 is no longer supported.** `require.php` moves from `^8.2` to `^8.4`.

  **What you must do:** on PHP 8.4 or newer, nothing. On 8.2, either upgrade PHP first or stay on the previous release — it keeps working and is unaffected by this.

- **BREAKING — Laravel 11 and 12 are no longer supported.** The framework requirement narrows from `^11.0|^12.0|^13.0` to `^13.0`.

  **What you must do:** on Laravel 13, nothing. On 11 or 12, stay on the previous release until you upgrade the framework.

- CI now tests PHP 8.4 with Laravel 13 only, instead of a matrix spanning versions this package no longer claims to support. A matrix that tests what the manifest forbids is worse than none — it reports green for a combination nobody can install.

### Why

These are the kit 0.5 platform floors. The suite was split across PHP 8.2 and 8.3 with the framework spanning 11–13, so no package could rely on anything newer than its weakest sibling. Every PHP package in the kit takes the same floors at once, so a consumer never has to resolve a mix.

Pre-1.0, so this lands in a MINOR. **No API changed, nothing was removed, nothing was renamed** — only what the package requires.


## 0.5.0 — 2026-06-05

### Added

- hidden ("secret") achievements

## 0.4.2 — 2026-05-27

- Maintenance only (1 internal commit).

## 0.4.1 — 2026-05-27

### Changed

- Rename package: particleacademy/laravel-fun-lab -> particle-academy/laravel-fun-lab

### Changed

- Package renamed on Packagist from `particleacademy/laravel-fun-lab` to `particle-academy/laravel-fun-lab` to match the `particle-academy/*` namespace convention.
- `composer.json` declares `replace: { "particleacademy/laravel-fun-lab": "self.version" }`, so existing consumers continue to install without changing their `require` line. The old Packagist entry will be marked abandoned with the new name as its replacement.
- **Migration**: update your `composer.json` from `particleacademy/laravel-fun-lab` to `particle-academy/laravel-fun-lab` at your next convenience. No code changes required — namespaces (`LaravelFunLab\\`), service provider, and facade are unchanged.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-21

> ⚠️  **Breaking changes — read the migration notes below before upgrading.**

### Breaking

- `config('lfl.api.writes')` default flipped from `true` to `false`. Consumers relying on write endpoints must explicitly set `LFL_API_WRITES=true` (or override the config).
- Catalog-setup POSTs (`/gamed-metrics`, `/metric-levels`, `/achievements`, `/prizes`) are now gated by a second flag, `config('lfl.api.allow_setup_over_http')`, defaulting to `false`.
- Write endpoints now require an authorization callable via `LaravelFunLab\Http\AuthorizerRegistry` (or a FQCN in `config('lfl.authorize.*')`). No callable + `allow_missing=false` → 403. Wire your policy in a service provider's `boot()`.
- `config('lfl.awardables')` must explicitly list every model class LFL is permitted to treat as an awardable over HTTP. Empty allowlist → all HTTP writes return 422.
- `LFLServiceProvider::boot()` throws `RuntimeException` when `api.writes=true` AND `api.auth.middleware=null` (previously a silent footgun). Set `LFL_API_AUTH_MIDDLEWARE=auth:sanctum` or similar.
- `Profile::$fillable` no longer includes `total_xp`, `achievement_count`, `prize_count`, `last_activity_at`. Code that does `$profile->update(['total_xp' => X])` now silently drops those fields. Use the new `Profile::setAggregates([...])` helper for internal/test/migration call-sites.
- `AwardXpBuilder::save()` now throws `LaravelFunLab\Exceptions\AwardRejectedException` (subclass of `InvalidArgumentException`) for:
  - amounts above `config('lfl.defaults.max_points_per_action')` (new default: 10000),
  - awards rejected by any registered `AwardValidationPipeline` step (XP path was bypassing the pipeline before),
  - opted-out recipients (matching existing Grant behavior).
- `AwardXpRequest` validation adds a `max` rule derived from the same cap; oversized amounts return 422 before reaching the service layer.

### Security

- **Secure-by-default writes** (C1). See Breaking section above. `LFLServiceProvider::boot()` throws when writes are enabled without auth middleware — preventing the "enabled writes but no auth" footgun.

- **Secure-by-default writes** (C1). `config('lfl.api.writes')` now defaults to `false`. `LFLServiceProvider::boot()` throws `RuntimeException` when `writes=true` and `config('lfl.api.auth.middleware')` is `null` — preventing the "enabled writes but no auth" footgun.
- **Awardable allowlist** (C3). `config('lfl.awardables')` must explicitly list the model classes LFL is permitted to treat as awardables over HTTP. All write controllers + the broadcast channel authorization reject unlisted types BEFORE `class_exists()` triggers the autoloader, closing the attacker-controlled class-name reconnaissance vector.
- **Authorization hook with deny-by-default** (C2). New `config('lfl.authorize.{award,grant,opt,setup}')` callables run before every write. When `null`, writes return 403 (override with `allow_missing=true` for dev). Each callable receives `(?Model $user, array $context)`.
- **XP cap + validation pipeline + opt-out** (H1/H2). `AwardXpBuilder::save()` now invokes `AwardValidationPipeline::validate()` (matching `GrantBuilder`) and rejects amounts above `config('lfl.defaults.max_points_per_action')` (new default: 10000). `GamedMetricService::awardXp()` gates on `Profile::isOptedOut()` to match grant behavior. Rejection surfaces as `AwardRejectedException` with a `kind` discriminator.
- **Catalog audit trail** (H3). New `CatalogMutated` event dispatched by `AwardEngine::setup()`. Logged by `EventLogSubscriber` so every upsert-by-slug has a trace (actor, entity type, was_created, timestamp).
- **Setup-over-HTTP is opt-in** (H3). `POST /gamed-metrics`, `/achievements`, `/prizes`, `/metric-levels` are now gated by `config('lfl.api.allow_setup_over_http')` (default `false`) in addition to the general `api.writes` flag.
- **Visibility settings enforced** (H4). `ProfileController::show` denies anonymous reads with 403 when `Profile::visibility_settings.public === false`. Owner can still read their own profile.
- **Mass-assignment hardening** (M1). `Profile::$fillable` no longer includes `total_xp`, `achievement_count`, `prize_count`, `last_activity_at`. Internal helpers (`incrementXp`, `touchActivity`, `recalculateAggregations`) use `forceFill` or `increment` to bypass — consumer code cannot forge XP via `Profile::update($request->all())`.
- **Rate limit on writes** (M2). New `throttle:lfl-writes` named limiter (60/min per user or IP, configurable via `LFL_API_WRITES_PER_MINUTE`) applied to every POST endpoint.
- **Broadcasting docs: payload trust model** (M3). `docs/broadcasting.md` now explains that `reason`/`source`/`meta` fields in WebSocket payloads are user-supplied and must be sanitized by consumers before rendering.

### Added

- **REST API expansion for SPA consumers**
  - Write endpoints: `POST /awards`, `POST /grants`, `POST /profiles/{type}/{id}/opt-in`, `POST /profiles/{type}/{id}/opt-out`, gated by the new `config('lfl.api.writes')` flag
  - Current-user convenience endpoints: `GET /me/profile`, `GET /me/achievements`, `GET /me/awards` (require consumer-configured auth middleware)
  - Catalog endpoints: `GET /gamed-metrics`, `GET /metric-levels/{metric}`, `GET /prizes`
  - Setup-over-HTTP endpoints for admin flows: `POST /gamed-metrics`, `POST /metric-levels`, `POST /achievements`, `POST /prizes`
  - Hand-rolled OpenAPI 3.0 spec at `resources/openapi.yaml`, served as JSON at `GET /openapi.json`, publishable via `vendor:publish --tag=lfl-openapi`
- **Opt-in broadcasting**
  - `XpAwarded`, `AchievementUnlocked`, `PrizeAwarded` now implement `ShouldBroadcast`, gated by the new `config('lfl.events.broadcast')` flag (default `false`)
  - Private channel naming: `private-lfl.profile.{AwardableType}.{id}` (backslashes in type replaced with dots)
  - Channel authorization registered automatically when broadcasting is enabled
  - `broadcastAs` event names: `xp.awarded`, `achievement.unlocked`, `prize.awarded`
  - `broadcastWith` payloads match the corresponding REST Resource shape so clients see one schema across REST and WebSockets
- **New docs**: `docs/react.md` (SPA integration), `docs/broadcasting.md` (real-time events)

### Changed

- **Eloquent API Resources refactor**
  - All API controllers now return Eloquent API Resources (`ProfileResource`, `LeaderboardEntryResource`, `AchievementResource`, `AwardResource`, `AwardGrantResource`, `GamedMetricResource`, `MetricLevelResource`, `PrizeResource`)
  - Unified `{ data, meta?, links?, profile? }` envelope across all endpoints
- **Config**
  - `config('lfl.api.writes')` added (default: `true`)
  - `config('lfl.events.broadcast')` added (default: `false`)
  - Inline comments clarify that `config('lfl.api.auth.middleware')` is the consumer's contract — LFL ships no auth implementation
- **Framework-only boundary**
  - Reinforced: LFL ships no authentication, no AI/ML, no transport driver. Consumers wrap their own security and infrastructure.

### Added (deps)

- `illuminate/http`, `illuminate/routing`, `illuminate/validation` made explicit (previously resolved via `illuminate/support`)
- `symfony/yaml` for serving the OpenAPI spec as JSON
